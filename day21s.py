'''
Starter code for class on 3/9/26
We have a Donut class and a PremiumDonut(Donut) class
They each have two class variables -- one for flavors, and one for what type of
thing you are.
They have your usual attributes which are intenral (_) and their property and
setters
Super class has __str__ and __eq__, not overridden by sublcass
We'll add:
* Class method as alt to the usual init
* Class method to return the menu (like @property but for a class variable)
* Static method to validate a coupon code
Look out for:
* @classmethod, @staticmethod decorators
* A class method has cls as its first parameter, instead of self
* A static method has no cls or self, it looks more like an ordinary function
* cls._menu -- this is dynamic and helps with inheritance in a class method
* type(self)._menu -- this is dynamic and helps with inheritance in a regular
method!
