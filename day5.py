CS2100
Spring 2026
Starter code for class on 1/21/26
This is roughly the same as the code we finished with on Wednesday 1/14,
and we prompt the user for some running data for Nate & Laney,
and then generate some stats
On Wednesday 1/21, we want to add a function similar to gather_mileage_input,
but it should read from a file instead of prompting the user .We'll need:
- the files to read from, laney_stats.txt and nate_stats.txt in the same
directory
- when we read from files, just like with input(), we have strings unless
we tell Python otherwise
- with open as(filename, "r", encoding = "utf-8") as infile
- infile.readlines() or infile.readline()
- split() turns a string into a list
