CS2100
Spring 2026
This is "finished" code from class on 1/26/26
1/26 is a snow day (kinda!) and we're doing class online.
Instead of building this code together live as we normally do,
this finished code will be posted on canvas so you can review.
We'll try to keep the live Zoom class as short as possible!
