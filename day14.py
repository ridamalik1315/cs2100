'''
Class to represent a podcast
Starter code for lecture on 2/18/26
The starter code:
* has a constructor to instantiate a Podcast object
(including three internal attributes (_) and one private attribute
(__))
* has @property to get the _title attribute from outside the class
* has @title.setter to set the _title attribute from outside the class
* has _validate_duration (a helper method, _ meaning for internal use)
* has __str__ method to return a nicely formatted version of the podcast
We'll add:
* streamline the constructor to work with validation we're already doing
* @property and @host.setter for the _host attribute
* our own __len__ to return the number of episodes so far via len()
* add_episode method so we can add episodes to the podcast
