Spring 2026
Starter code for lecture on 2/2/26
The starter code picks up where we left off on Thursday 1/29!
We're working with the file all_games.csv, which is a dataset containing PWHL
games from 2023-2025
Instructions:
- jump down to PART TWO, CONTINUED
- read up on the Pandas documentation to answer the questions -
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
- code up your answers and see how they work!
- we'll go over them all together
