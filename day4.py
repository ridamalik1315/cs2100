Spring 2026
Starter code for class on 1/14/26
This is roughly the same as the code we finished with on Monday 1/12, except...
* Dictionaries instead of lists are everywhere (gather_mileage_input, and
generate_mileage_stats)
* A new function just prints out the summary for a given runner.
On Wednesday 1/14, we want to add to generate_mileage_stats:
* in case of an empty dictionary or None, return None
* in case of negative miles, raise an error
