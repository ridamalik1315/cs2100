Finished code from class -- 1/12/26
This program prompts the user for the daily mileage of two runners and compares
them.
In class, we changed a list into a dictionary, where we went from:
* stats[0] = total mileage
* stats[1] = avg daily mileage
to a dictionary with:
* stats["total miles"] = total mileage
* stats["avg daily"] = avg daily mileage
Before posting this code, Laney also changed the othere lists into
dictionaries, so we have:
* laney_stats["date"] = miles on that date
* nate_stats["date"] = miles on that date
For testing generate_mileage_stats...
* basic cases are ok :)
* how should we handle empty input?
* how should we handle negative miles?
For wednesday 1/13, we will consider edge cases of an empty input, or negative
miles.
We'll also write a function to generate the report, and test that too.
Empty input options...
* Python raises an error
**** We raise an error (better error message)
**** Return zeroes {"total" : 0, "avg" : 0}
* Return None
Negative miles options...
***** we raise an error
* return None
* leave it as-is (do the computation with negatives)
