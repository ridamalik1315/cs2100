CS2100
Spring 2026
Starter code for class on Wednesday 2/11/26
These are practice problems! Fill in the function stubs for as many
or as few as you would like.
Notice the use of the Any type. That's because these functions will work
the same no matter what is contained in their list/set/tuple/dictionary :)
We'll work together on a few them during class, and then run the tests
in test_lec14.py to make sure everything works as expected.
Pick your favorites... (starred ones are MOST relevant for quiz 2)
1. **create_email (practice with default params and strings)
2. normalize_lst (normalization with a list instead of a dataframe)
3. dedupe (practice with data structures)
4. **find_common (practice with data structures)
5. swap_pairs (practice with tuples)
6. has_required (practice with sets)
7. **get_seconds (practice with lists and dictionaries)
8. **Book class (practice with classes and objects, __str__, default params)
