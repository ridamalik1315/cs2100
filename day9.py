Spring 2026
Starter code for lecture on 1/29/26
The starter code is just comments! We're working with the file
all_games.py, which is a dataset containing PWHL games from 2023-2025
We'll be using Pandas today, which is a Python library that is super handy
for working with files, especially files that are messy, have mixed data types,
etc.
Pandas Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
Instructions:
- each comment below describes a task we want to accomplish using pandas
- with a teammate, look up in the pandas documentation how it should work
- then we'll put it into the real code below
'''
#######################################################
#
# PART ONE
#
#######################################################
# 1. read all_games.csv into a dataframe
# 2. what's in the dataframe?
# 3. how big is the dataframe? how many rows/columns?
# 4. what are the names of the columns in the dataframe?
# 5. what are the datatypes of the columns?
#######################################################
#
# PART TWO
#
#######################################################
# 6. ask the user for a column name and tell them if it's there
col = input("What column are you looking for?\n")
# 7. make a copy of the dataframe. (bonus question: why??)
# 8. add a new column that has total goals (instead of home goals, visit goals)
# 9. how many games went into overtime?
# 10. how many times were there 0 total goals in a game? 1? 2? 3? ...
# 11. can we sort the dataframe by date?
#######################################################
#
# PART THREE
#
#######################################################
# 12. filter the dataframe so we just see the rows where total goals were 0
# 13. filter the dataframe so we just see boston vs new york
# (either could be home/visiting)
# (boston team is 1, NY is 4)
# 14. Print out boston vs new york, but only some of the columns, so we see
# who was the home team, how many goals the home team had, how many goals the
visiting
# team had.
# 15. How many games had boston vs new york?
# 16. how many of those games did boston win?
